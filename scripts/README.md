### ðŸ“Š Deployment Script Standards

#### Script Structure
All production deployment scripts follow this standardized structure:

1. **Header and Configuration**
   - Script metadata (version, purpose, date)
   - Environment configuration
   - Color coding for output

2. **Pre-Deployment Checks**
   - System requirements validation
   - Database connectivity verification
   - Disk space and resource checks
   - Feature compatibility validation

3. **Backup Procedures**
   - Database backup creation
   - Backup integrity verification
   - Backup metadata generation

4. **Deployment Execution**
   - Service shutdown (minimal downtime)
   - Code deployment and verification
   - Dependency management
   - Service restart

5. **Health Checks and Validation**
   - System health verification
   - Feature functionality testing
   - Performance validation
   - Security checks

6. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Deployment monitoring configuration
   - Performance metrics setup
   - Error tracking initialization

7. **Post-Deployment Documentation**
   - Deployment summary generation
   - Success metrics reporting
   - Next steps documentation

#### Script Naming Convention
- Format: `deploy-{version|epic|feature}-production.sh`
- Examples:
  - `deploy-v3.1.0-production.sh` (version-based)
  - `deploy-epic6-production.sh` (epic-based)
- All scripts must be executable (`chmod +x`)

#### Script Requirements
- **Error Handling**: `set -e` and `set -u` for strict error handling
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging with timestamps and color coding
- **Backup**: Mandatory database backup before deployment
- **Validation**: Pre and post-deployment validation procedures
- **Rollback**: Clear rollback procedures and instructions
- **Documentation**: Inline documentation and usage instructions

### ðŸ”§ Deployment Script Usage

#### Running a Deployment Script
```bash
# Make script executable (if not already)
chmod +x scripts/deploy-{script-name}.sh

# Run deployment script
sudo ./scripts/deploy-{script-name}.sh

# Monitor deployment logs
tail -f /opt/drishti/logs/*.log
```

#### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Verify system requirements and resources
- [ ] Ensure database backup procedures are ready
- [ ] Confirm rollback procedures are tested
- [ ] Validate deployment script permissions
- [ ] Review deployment impact and downtime expectations

#### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Verify all services are running correctly
- [ ] Test critical application functionality
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics and error rates
- [ ] Validate deployment success metrics
- [ ] Update deployment documentation

### ðŸ“š Deployment History

#### Removed Scripts (Cleanup - December 2024)
The following scripts were removed as they were redundant or superseded:

- `deploy-production-epic6.sh` - Partial Epic 6 deployment (Stories 6.1-6.2 only)
- `deploy-story-6.3-production.sh` - Individual Story 6.3 deployment
- `deploy-epic6-complete-production.sh` - Intermediate Epic 6 deployment
- `deploy-story-6.5-production.sh` - Individual Story 6.5 deployment

**Reason for Removal**: These scripts were superseded by comprehensive deployment scripts that cover complete feature sets rather than partial deployments.

#### Deployment Timeline
- **v1.3.0**: Initial Epic 6 Stories 6.1-6.2 deployment
- **v1.5.0**: Story 6.3 Tax Treatment deployment
- **v2.2.0**: Story 6.5 Net Worth Tracking deployment
- **v3.0.0**: Complete Epic 6 Financial Account Management deployment
- **v3.1.0**: Major Documentation Reorganization and Code Improvements (Current)

### ðŸ”’ Security and Access Control

#### Script Security
- All deployment scripts require sudo privileges
- Scripts include comprehensive input validation
- Database operations use secure connection methods
- Backup files are created with restricted permissions

#### Access Control
- Deployment scripts should only be executed by authorized DevOps personnel
- Production deployments require approval and coordination
- All deployments must be logged and documented
- Emergency rollback procedures must be readily available

### ðŸ“ž Support and Troubleshooting

#### Deployment Issues
- Check deployment logs in `/opt/drishti/logs/`
- Verify system resources and requirements
- Validate database connectivity and integrity
- Review rollback procedures if deployment fails

#### Contact Information
