## Epic 13: Frontend V2 — Dashboard UI v1 (Mobile)

Context: Align Dashboard with Frontend_V2_Integration_RFC.md. Deliver a clear, scannable home with status chip, Net Worth card + 12m chart, Streaks & Wins, Quick Actions, and a non‑obtrusive snackbar.

### User Story 13.1 — Phase A: Structure & Hierarchy (Dashboard layout)

As a user, I want the Dashboard to present information in a clear hierarchy so I can scan status, net worth, and next actions quickly.

Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Status row at top: Offline/Online chip (left) + sync text/icon (right)
- [x] Section order: Net Worth card → Streaks & Wins → Quick Actions
- [x] Consistent spacing using theme.spacing; card padding standardized
- [x] OfflineIndicator uses compact “chip” style by default on Dashboard
- [x] Quick Action buttons size reduced; do not dominate viewport
- [x] Snackbar/toast sits above tab bar; never overlaps navigation
- [x] No behavioral changes to services; purely presentational/layout
- [x] Works on small phones (≤360dp width) without overflow or clipping
- [x] Respects light, dark, and “sun” palette without hardcoded colors

Definition of Done
