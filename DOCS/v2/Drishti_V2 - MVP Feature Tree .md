4️⃣ Differentiation Strategy 
1. Privacy-first — no bank login, optional cloud, on-device only mode. 
2. Scenario-first UX — default view isn’t just “balance today” but “where you’re 
headed”. 
3. AI as an assistant, not a gimmick — small nudges, goal adjustments, monthly 
report. 
4. Focused niche marketing — target FIRE, freelancers, expats, privacy-conscious 
users. 
 

5️⃣ Revenue Logic 
• Free tier gets you installs + trust (no bank login barrier). 
• Pro tier monetizes committed planners who value projections + AI insights. 
• Add-ons monetize specific segments without forcing a full upgrade. 
• Cloud sync is an optional upsell for privacy-conscious users who still want backup.
