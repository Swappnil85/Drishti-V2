# Drishti_V2 ‚Äî Build Documentation

_Last updated: 2025-08-12 (AET)_

## Purpose
This README is the **local index** for Drishti_V2 build documentation.  
It reflects the files currently in this `DOCS/v2/` folder. Older PRDs, epics, and stories have been superseded.

## üìÇ Core Planning Docs (current)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Drishti_V2_Detailed_Epics.docx** / **EPICS.md** | Final definition of all epics (E1‚ÄìE21) with scope, DoD, dependencies, KPIs, and risks. |
| **Drishti_V2_Master_PRD_2025-08-12.docx** / **PRD.md** | Master PRD for V2 (functional + non‚Äëfunctional requirements). |

---

## üìÇ User Stories (agent working set)

The `stories/` folder contains **per‚Äëepic Markdown files** (agent‚Äëready).  
- Open the epic you‚Äôre working on (e.g., `E4-NAV_UI.md`) and implement stories top‚Äëto‚Äëbottom.  
- `USER_STORIES.md` inside `stories/` is the index + conventions + shared NFRs.  
- `stories_manifest.json` is machine‚Äëreadable (for issue automation).

**Compiled references (searchable only):**  
- **Drishti_V2_USER_STORIES_MVP.md** ‚Äî _reference only_ (all MVP stories in one file).  
- **Drishti_V2_USER_STORIES_PRO.md** ‚Äî _reference only_ (all Pro/Post‚ÄëMVP stories).  

> Devs should work from `stories/*.md` files, not the compiled reference docs.

## üóëÔ∏è Deprecated (safe to remove or archive)
- `PRD.md` (old) ‚Äî replaced by **Drishti_V2_Master_PRD_2025-08-12.docx**.  
- `EPICS.md` (old) ‚Äî replaced by **Drishti_V2_Detailed_Epics.docx**.

> Prefer archiving to `DOCS/_archive/v2-legacy/` to keep history.

## ‚ùì Other docs in repo ‚Äî keep or archive?

| File | Keep? | Rationale |
|------|------|-----------|
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** | **Keep if current**; otherwise archive. | Should describe V2 app architecture (modules, data flow, local DB, encryption, entitlement gates). If it references deprecated systems (e.g., bank sync) or V1 tech, archive. |
| **CUTOVER_PLAN.md** | **Keep if you‚Äôre planning a V1‚ÜíV2 transition**; else archive. | Useful when dates/environments and rollback are active. If V2 is greenfield or cutover is done, archive. |
| **PARITY_CHECKLIST.md** | **Keep if tracking feature parity with V1**; else archive. | If parity is not a goal for V2, or checklist is stale, archive. |

---

## ‚úÖ Maintenance
- Update this README whenever files in `DOCS/v2/` change.  
- Archive stale documents rather than deleting when possible.  
- Keep story IDs stable (`E{epic}-S{#}`) and update `stories_manifest.json` if stories move.
