# QA Framework for Drishti Project

## Overview

This document establishes the Quality Assurance framework for the Drishti financial planning application. As the QA Engineer, this framework ensures comprehensive testing, validation, and quality control throughout the development lifecycle.

## QA Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Functional Validation**: Ensure all user stories meet acceptance criteria
