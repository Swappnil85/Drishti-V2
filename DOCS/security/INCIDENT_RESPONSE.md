# Security Incident Response Plan

## Overview
This document outlines Drishti's security incident response procedures to ensure rapid detection, containment, and recovery from security incidents.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

- **High (P1)**: Security vulnerability exploitation, unauthorized access
- **Medium (P2)**: Suspicious activity, policy violations
- **Low (P3)**: Security configuration issues, minor policy violations

### Incident Types
- Data breach or unauthorized data access
- System compromise or malware infection
- Certificate/TLS issues
- Authentication/authorization failures
- DDoS or availability attacks
- Insider threats
- Third-party security incidents

## Response Team

### Core Team
- **Incident Commander**: Overall response coordination
- **Security Lead**: Technical security analysis and containment
- **Engineering Lead**: System recovery and technical fixes
- **Legal/Compliance**: Regulatory requirements and notifications
- **Communications**: Internal and external communications

### Contact Information

   - Document initial findings

2. **Evidence Collection**
   - Preserve system logs
   - Capture network traffic
   - Document system state
   - Secure evidence chain

### Phase 2: Containment (1-4 hours)
1. **Short-term Containment**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Block malicious traffic
   - Disable compromised accounts
   - Implement emergency patches

2. **Long-term Containment**
   - Apply permanent fixes
   - Update security controls
   - Strengthen monitoring
   - Validate containment effectiveness

### Phase 3: Eradication and Recovery (4-24 hours)
1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Determine scope of compromise
   - Assess data impact
   - Document lessons learned

2. **System Recovery**
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Rebuild compromised systems
   - Update security configurations
   - Validate system integrity

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Activities (24+ hours)
1. **Documentation**
   - Complete incident report
   - Update response procedures
   - Conduct post-mortem review
   - Share lessons learned

2. **Notifications**
   - Regulatory reporting (GDPR, CCPA)
   - Customer notifications
   - Partner communications
   - Public disclosure (if required)

## Automated Response

### Monitoring Triggers
- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Unusual data access patterns
- Certificate expiration warnings
- Security scan alerts
- System performance anomalies

### Automated Actions
- Account lockouts for brute force attempts
- IP blocking for suspicious traffic
- Alert escalation for critical events
- Evidence collection and preservation
- Emergency contact notifications

## Communication Templates
