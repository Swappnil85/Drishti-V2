# Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Process

## Overview
This document outlines the Privacy Impact Assessment process for new features and changes to Drishti's data processing activities.

## When to Conduct a PIA

### Mandatory PIA Triggers
- New data collection or processing activities
- Changes to data retention periods
- New third-party integrations
- Changes to data sharing practices
- Implementation of new tracking technologies
- Significant changes to privacy policy
- New automated decision-making processes

### Risk-Based Assessment
Conduct PIA when processing is likely to result in high risk to individuals, including:
- Large-scale processing of personal data
- Processing of sensitive financial information
- Systematic monitoring of individuals
- Processing of vulnerable populations' data
- Use of new technologies or AI/ML systems

## PIA Process Steps

### Step 1: Initial Screening (1-2 days)
1. **Project Description**
   - Feature/change overview
   - Business justification
   - Timeline and stakeholders
   - Technical implementation details

2. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - What data is collected?
   - How is it processed?
   - Where is it stored?
   - Who has access?
   - How long is it retained?

3. **Risk Threshold Assessment**
   - Use DPIA_TEMPLATE.md for initial evaluation
   - Determine if full PIA is required
   - Document screening decision

### Step 2: Detailed Assessment (3-5 days)
1. **Legal Basis Analysis**
   - Identify lawful basis under GDPR Article 6
   - Special category data assessment (Article 9)
   - Legitimate interests assessment if applicable

2. **Data Subject Rights Impact**
   - Access and portability implications
   - Rectification and erasure capabilities
   - Objection and restriction mechanisms
   - Consent withdrawal processes

3. **Technical and Organizational Measures**
   - Data minimization implementation
   - Purpose limitation controls
   - Storage limitation mechanisms
   - Security measures assessment

### Step 3: Risk Assessment (2-3 days)
1. **Privacy Risk Identification**
   - Unauthorized access risks
   - Data breach potential
   - Function creep possibilities
   - Discrimination or bias risks

2. **Risk Likelihood and Impact**
   - Probability assessment (Low/Medium/High)
   - Impact severity (Low/Medium/High)
   - Overall risk rating calculation
   - Vulnerable populations consideration

3. **Mitigation Measures**
   - Technical safeguards
   - Procedural controls
   - Training requirements
   - Monitoring mechanisms

### Step 4: Consultation and Review (2-3 days)
1. **Internal Review**
   - Legal team assessment
   - Security team evaluation
   - Engineering feasibility review
   - Product team alignment

2. **External Consultation** (if required)
   - Data Protection Officer consultation
   - Supervisory authority consultation
   - Stakeholder feedback collection
   - Expert opinion gathering

### Step 5: Decision and Documentation (1 day)
1. **Go/No-Go Decision**
   - Risk acceptance criteria
   - Mitigation adequacy assessment
   - Compliance confirmation
   - Business value justification

2. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Complete PIA report
   - Risk register updates
   - Policy updates needed
   - Training material updates
