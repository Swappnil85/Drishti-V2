# Epic 3: Core Data Models & Local Database - QA Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for Epic 3, focusing on core financial data models, local database implementation, and API services.

## Test Scope
- Database schema validation
- API endpoint functionality
- Mobile database models (WatermelonDB)
- Data validation and error handling
- Authentication and authorization
- Offline functionality

## Test Environment Setup
- PostgreSQL database with test data
- Node.js API server running locally
- React Native mobile app with WatermelonDB
- Test user accounts with various financial scenarios

## 1. Database Schema Tests

### 1.1 Table Structure Validation
- [ ] Verify all tables are created with correct columns
- [ ] Validate foreign key relationships
- [ ] Test database constraints and indexes
- [ ] Verify default values and nullable fields

### 1.2 Data Integrity Tests
- [ ] Test cascade deletes for user accounts
- [ ] Validate unique constraints (email, scenario defaults)
- [ ] Test data type validations
- [ ] Verify timestamp auto-updates

## 2. API Endpoint Tests

### 2.1 Authentication Tests
- [ ] Valid login with correct credentials
- [ ] Invalid login attempts (wrong password, non-existent user)
- [ ] JWT token validation and expiration
- [ ] Protected route access without authentication
- [ ] Token refresh functionality

### 2.2 Financial API Testing
**Complete API Documentation**: See [Epic 3 Financial API Documentation](./API_DOCUMENTATION_EPIC3.md) for detailed endpoint specifications.

**Core API Standards**: All endpoints follow standard patterns defined in [API Overview](../../api/API_OVERVIEW.md):
- JWT Authentication required
- Standard response formats
- Error handling patterns
- Rate limiting compliance

#### Account Management API Tests
- [ ] **Account CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, delete accounts
  - [ ] Valid account creation and validation
  - [ ] User-specific account access
  - [ ] Pagination and filtering
  - [ ] Soft delete implementation

#### Goal Management API Tests
- [ ] **Goal CRUD Operations** - Financial goal management
  - [ ] Goal creation with account association
  - [ ] Progress tracking and updates
  - [ ] Target date validation
  - [ ] User-specific goal access

#### Scenario Management API Tests
- [ ] **Scenario Operations** - Financial planning scenarios
  - [ ] Scenario creation and management
  - [ ] Goal association validation
  - [ ] Financial calculation endpoints
  - [ ] Performance optimization testing

#### API Integration Tests
- [ ] **Cross-endpoint workflows** - Complete user journeys
- [ ] **Data consistency** - Referential integrity
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Response times and load
- [ ] **Security testing** - Authentication and authorization

## 3. Mobile Database Tests (WatermelonDB)

### 3.1 Model Creation and Relationships
- [ ] User model creation and validation
- [ ] FinancialAccount model with user relationship
- [ ] FinancialGoal model with user relationship
- [ ] Scenario model with user relationship
- [ ] Cross-model relationship queries

### 3.2 Offline Functionality
- [ ] Data persistence without network
- [ ] Local CRUD operations
- [ ] Sync status tracking
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategies

### 3.3 Data Validation
- [ ] Client-side validation rules
- [ ] Type safety enforcement
- [ ] Required field validation
- [ ] Format validation (emails, currencies, dates)

## 4. Integration Tests

### 4.1 End-to-End User Flows
- [ ] **Account Creation Flow**
  1. User registers/logs in
  2. Creates first financial account
  3. Verifies account appears in list
  4. Updates account details
  5. Views account summary
- [ ] **Goal Setting Flow**
  1. User creates financial goal
  2. Sets target amount and date
  3. Adds initial progress
  4. Updates progress over time
  5. Completes goal
- [ ] **Scenario Planning Flow**
  1. User creates financial scenario
  2. Sets planning assumptions
  3. Adds goals to scenario
  4. Calculates projections
  5. Compares multiple scenarios

### 4.2 Data Synchronization
- [ ] API to mobile sync
- [ ] Mobile to API sync
- [ ] Conflict resolution
- [ ] Partial sync handling
- [ ] Network interruption recovery

## 5. Performance Tests

### 5.1 API Performance
- [ ] Response times under normal load
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Large dataset handling
- [ ] Concurrent user scenarios

### 5.2 Mobile Performance
- [ ] Local database query speed
- [ ] Memory usage with large datasets
- [ ] App startup time
- [ ] Sync performance

## 6. Security Tests

### 6.1 Authentication Security
- [ ] Password strength requirements
- [ ] JWT token security
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Brute force protection

### 6.2 Data Access Security
- [ ] User data isolation
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Input sanitization
- [ ] Authorization checks

## 7. Error Handling Tests

### 7.1 API Error Responses
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Meaningful error messages
- [ ] Error logging
- [ ] Graceful degradation

### 7.2 Mobile Error Handling
- [ ] Network connectivity issues
- [ ] Database errors
- [ ] Validation failures
- [ ] User-friendly error messages

## Test Data Requirements

### Sample Users
- User with multiple accounts (checking, savings, investment)
- User with various goal types and priorities
- User with multiple scenarios
- New user with no data

### Sample Financial Data
- Different account types with realistic balances
- Goals with various target dates and amounts
- Scenarios with different assumption sets
- Historical transaction data

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All API endpoints return correct responses
- [ ] Mobile app functions offline and syncs properly
- [ ] Data validation prevents invalid entries
- [ ] Security measures protect user data
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Error handling provides good user experience
