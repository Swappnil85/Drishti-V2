4. Preserve all functionality
5. Indefinite recovery period

**Archive Benefits**:
- Hide closed accounts without deletion
- Maintain complete historical data
- Easy restoration when needed
- Clean main account interface

### Merge Operations
**Merge Process**:
1. Detect similar accounts using algorithm
2. Present merge candidates with similarity scores
3. Preview combined balance and data
4. Consolidate balances with audit trail
5. Soft delete source account
6. Update metadata with merge information

**Merge Safety**:
- Comprehensive confirmation dialogs
- Balance verification before merge
- Complete audit trail
- Reversible through recovery system

## Advanced Features

### Similarity Detection Algorithm
**String Similarity Calculation**:
```typescript
const getStringSimilarity = (str1: string, str2: string): number => {
  const longer = str1.length > str2.length ? str1 : str2;
  const shorter = str1.length > str2.length ? str2 : str1;
  
  if (longer.length === 0) return 1.0;
  
  const editDistance = getEditDistance(longer, shorter);
  return (longer.length - editDistance) / longer.length;
};
```

**Merge Candidate Scoring**:
- Minimum 30% similarity threshold
- Weighted scoring system
- Multiple similarity factors
- Ranked candidate presentation
