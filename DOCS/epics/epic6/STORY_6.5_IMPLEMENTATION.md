## Net Worth Calculation Engine

### Asset and Liability Classification
**Smart Classification**:
```typescript
const isLiabilityAccount = (accountType: string, balance: number): boolean => {
  const liabilityTypes = ['credit', 'loan', 'mortgage', 'debt'];
  return liabilityTypes.includes(accountType.toLowerCase()) || balance < 0;
};
```

**Calculation Logic**:
- Assets: All positive balances from non-liability account types
- Liabilities: All negative balances and debt-type accounts
- Net Worth: Total Assets - Total Liabilities

### Historical Trend Analysis
**Trend Calculation**:
- Reconstructs historical net worth from balance history
- Calculates daily changes and percentage variations
- Provides trend indicators (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Supports configurable time periods (30, 90, 180, 365, 730 days)

### Milestone System
**Predefined Milestones**:
- First $10K: Entry-level financial milestone
- Quarter to 100K ($25K): Early savings achievement
- Half Way to 100K ($50K): Significant progress marker
- Six Figures ($100K): Major psychological milestone
- Quarter Million ($250K): Substantial wealth accumulation
- Half Million ($500K): High net worth threshold
- Millionaire ($1M): Elite financial status
- Multi-Millionaire ($2M+): Ultra-high net worth

**Progress Calculation**:
```typescript
const progress = Math.min(currentNetWorth / milestone.amount, 1);
const achieved = currentNetWorth >= milestone.amount;
```
