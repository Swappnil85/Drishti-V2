## 🗄️ Database Migration Guide

### Migration Path: Schema v1 → v4

**Breaking Changes**: Yes - Database migration required  
**Migration Steps**: 3 incremental migrations  
**Estimated Time**: < 5 minutes

#### Step 1: Create Database Backup
```bash
# Create full database backup
sqlite3 /path/to/production/drishti.db ".backup /path/to/backup/drishti_pre_epic6_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db"

# Verify backup integrity
sqlite3 /path/to/backup/drishti_pre_epic6_*.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

#### Step 2: Verify Current Schema Version
```sql
-- Check current schema version
SELECT version FROM schema_version;
-- Expected result: 1
```

#### Step 3: Execute Migration v1 → v2 (Epic 6.1)
**Purpose**: Add enhanced account fields for account management

```sql
-- Add new columns to financial_accounts table
ALTER TABLE financial_accounts ADD COLUMN institution_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE financial_accounts ADD COLUMN routing_number TEXT;
ALTER TABLE financial_accounts ADD COLUMN account_number_encrypted TEXT;
ALTER TABLE financial_accounts ADD COLUMN tax_treatment TEXT;
ALTER TABLE financial_accounts ADD COLUMN tags TEXT DEFAULT '[]';
ALTER TABLE financial_accounts ADD COLUMN color TEXT;
ALTER TABLE financial_accounts ADD COLUMN linked_account_ids TEXT DEFAULT '[]';

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_financial_accounts_institution_id ON financial_accounts(institution_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_financial_accounts_tax_treatment ON financial_accounts(tax_treatment);

-- Update schema version
UPDATE schema_version SET version = 2;
```

#### Step 4: Execute Migration v2 → v3 (Intermediate)
**Purpose**: Prepare for balance history tracking

```sql
-- Update schema version
UPDATE schema_version SET version = 3;
```

#### Step 5: Execute Migration v3 → v4 (Epic 6.2)
**Purpose**: Add balance history tracking

```sql
-- Create balance_history table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS balance_history (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    account_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    previous_balance REAL NOT NULL,
    new_balance REAL NOT NULL,
    change_amount REAL NOT NULL,
    change_percentage REAL NOT NULL,
    update_method TEXT NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    metadata TEXT DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES financial_accounts(id)
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_balance_history_account_id ON balance_history(account_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_balance_history_update_method ON balance_history(update_method);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_balance_history_created_at ON balance_history(created_at);

-- Update schema version
UPDATE schema_version SET version = 4;
```

#### Step 6: Verify Migration Success
```sql
-- Verify final schema version
SELECT version FROM schema_version;
-- Expected result: 4

-- Verify new tables exist
.tables
-- Should include: balance_history

-- Verify new columns exist
PRAGMA table_info(financial_accounts);
-- Should include new columns: institution_id, routing_number, etc.
```
