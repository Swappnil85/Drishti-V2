## Debt Calculation Engine

### Debt Account Classification

**Smart Classification**:

```typescript
const isDebtAccount = (accountType: string): boolean => {
  return ['credit', 'loan'].includes(accountType.toLowerCase());
};
```

**Debt Summary Calculation**:

- Total Debt: Sum of absolute values of all debt account balances
- Minimum Payments: Sum of all required minimum monthly payments
- Average Interest Rate: Weighted average based on account balances
- Monthly Interest Cost: Sum of monthly interest charges across all accounts

### Payoff Strategy Analysis

**Snowball Method**:

- Orders debts by balance (smallest to largest)
- Focuses extra payments on smallest balance first
- Provides psychological wins through quick account payoffs
- Calculates total interest and payoff time

**Avalanche Method**:

- Orders debts by interest rate (highest to lowest)
- Focuses extra payments on highest interest rate first
- Minimizes total interest paid over time
- Provides maximum mathematical savings

### Interest Projection System

**Projection Calculation**:

- Monthly interest charge calculation using account interest rates
- Principal payment calculation based on minimum payments
- Balance reduction tracking over specified time periods
- Total interest cost projection for current payment schedules

### Debt-to-Income Analysis

**Industry Benchmarks**:

- Excellent: ≤10% (optimal debt management)
- Good: ≤20% (healthy debt levels)
- Fair: ≤36% (manageable but improvable)
- Poor: ≤50% (concerning debt levels)
- Dangerous: >50% (requires immediate attention)

**Ratio Calculation**:

```typescript
const ratio = (monthlyDebtPayments / monthlyIncome) * 100;
```
