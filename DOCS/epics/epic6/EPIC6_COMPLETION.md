**Current Status Metrics:**

- 🔄 70% of planned features implemented (code created but not integrated)
- ❌ 0% test coverage (all tests failing due to setup issues)
- ⚠️ Database schema updates required
- ⚠️ Component integration incomplete
- ✅ Service layer architecture completed
- ✅ Component files created
- ✅ Documentation framework established

**Remaining Work Required:**

1. **Database Schema Updates** - Add enhanced fields for tags, colors, institution relationships
2. **Test Configuration Fix** - Resolve Jest setup and dependency issues
3. **Component Integration** - Connect components to actual database schema
4. **Navigation Integration** - Ensure screens work within app navigation
5. **End-to-End Testing** - Verify complete workflows function correctly

The system has a solid foundation but requires additional integration work before production deployment.
