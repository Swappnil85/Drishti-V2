# Epic 9: Scenario Planning & Projections - Security Review

## Security Review Status

- **Review Status**: üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**
- **Current Phase**: Infrastructure Security Assessment
- **Review Date**: August 7, 2025
- **Reviewer**: Development Team
- **Security Level**: Development Phase

## Overview

This document provides a security assessment for Epic 9: Scenario Planning & Projections. As the epic is currently in the infrastructure development phase, this review focuses on the security measures implemented in the database integration and core platform compatibility work.

## Current Security Assessment

### Infrastructure Security ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

#### Database Security
- ‚úÖ **Web Platform Isolation**: Mock database implementation prevents direct access to production data
- ‚úÖ **Query Sanitization**: Implemented safe query handling in mock WatermelonDB interface
- ‚úÖ **Null Safety**: Comprehensive null checks prevent runtime security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Secure error handling prevents information leakage

#### Service Layer Security
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation**: ScenarioService includes input sanitization
- ‚úÖ **AsyncStorage Safety**: Proper availability checks prevent storage-related vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Secure implementation across web and native platforms

### Planned Security Features (Not Yet Implemented)

#### Data Protection (Planned)
- ‚ùå **Scenario Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive financial scenarios
- ‚ùå **Secure Sharing**: Encrypted sharing with expiration and access controls
- ‚ùå **Data Anonymization**: Privacy protection for shared scenarios
- ‚ùå **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of scenario access and modifications

#### Authentication & Authorization (Planned)
- ‚ùå **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels for scenario management
- ‚ùå **Secure API Endpoints**: Protected endpoints for scenario operations
- ‚ùå **Session Management**: Secure session handling for scenario editing
- ‚ùå **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks

#### Input Security (Planned)
- ‚ùå **XSS Prevention**: Comprehensive input sanitization for all user inputs
- ‚ùå **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries and input validation
- ‚ùå **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention
- ‚ùå **File Upload Security**: Secure handling of scenario imports/exports

## Security Risks & Mitigation

### Current Risks (Development Phase)

1. **Limited Production Security**
   - **Risk**: Development-phase security measures only
   - **Impact**: Low (development environment)
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive security implementation planned for production

2. **Mock Database Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Simplified security model in web database mock
   - **Impact**: Low (development/testing only)
   - **Mitigation**: Full security implementation when moving to production database

### Planned Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Sensitivity**
   - **Risk**: Financial scenarios contain sensitive personal information
   - **Planned Mitigation**: End-to-end encryption, secure storage, access controls

2. **Sharing Vulnerabilities**
   - **Risk**: Scenario sharing could expose sensitive data
   - **Planned Mitigation**: Anonymization, expiration controls, permission management

3. **Calculation Integrity**
   - **Risk**: Malicious input could affect financial calculations
   - **Planned Mitigation**: Input validation, calculation verification, audit trails

## Security Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Testing ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Database compatibility testing
- ‚úÖ Service layer error handling verification
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform security consistency

### Phase 2: Feature Security Testing (Planned)
- ‚ùå Input validation testing
- ‚ùå Authentication/authorization testing
- ‚ùå Data encryption verification
- ‚ùå Sharing security assessment

### Phase 3: Penetration Testing (Planned)
- ‚ùå Vulnerability scanning
- ‚ùå Security audit by external team
- ‚ùå Performance under attack simulation
- ‚ùå Compliance verification

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy (Planned)
- **GDPR Compliance**: User data protection and right to deletion
- **CCPA Compliance**: California privacy law compliance
- **Financial Data Protection**: Industry-standard financial data security

### Security Standards (Planned)
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls for financial applications
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management standards

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Development Phase)
1. **Implement Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
2. **Add Authentication**: Secure user authentication and session management
3. **Enable Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive scenario data
4. **Implement Audit Logging**: Track all scenario operations for security monitoring

### Long-term Security Goals
1. **Security Audit**: External security assessment before production
2. **Compliance Certification**: Achieve relevant financial data security certifications
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement real-time security monitoring
4. **Incident Response**: Develop comprehensive security incident response plan

## Security Documentation

### Current Documentation
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure security measures documented
- ‚úÖ Development phase security assessment completed
- ‚úÖ Security planning for production features

### Planned Documentation
- ‚ùå Comprehensive security architecture document
- ‚ùå Security testing procedures and results
- ‚ùå Incident response procedures
- ‚ùå Compliance certification documentation

## Conclusion

The current infrastructure work for Epic 9 includes appropriate security measures for the development phase. The mock database implementation and service layer modifications follow secure coding practices and include proper error handling and input validation.

As development progresses to implement the actual scenario planning features, comprehensive security measures must be implemented including encryption, authentication, authorization, and audit logging.

**Current Security Status**: ‚úÖ **ADEQUATE FOR DEVELOPMENT PHASE**
**Production Readiness**: ‚ùå **REQUIRES COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION**

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Development**: Implement planned scenario features with security-first approach
2. **Security Integration**: Build security measures into each feature as it's developed
3. **Testing Plan**: Execute comprehensive security testing before production deployment
4. **Documentation**: Maintain security documentation throughout development process
