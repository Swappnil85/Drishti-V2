# Epic 13 QA Report

## Scope
- Certificate pinning, monitoring, rotation
- GDPR/CCPA endpoints, retention jobs, consent audit trail
- Device integrity heuristics and attestation scaffolding
- Data export/delete formats and receipts
- Security audit, CI/CD automation, admin dashboards

## Test Results
- Consent endpoints: PASS
- Retention job scheduling (Redis): PASS (graceful skip without Redis)
- Certificate freshness endpoint: PASS
- PDF export: PASS (returns base64 or application/pdf)
- ZIP portability: PASS (manifest.json, export.json, accounts.csv)
- Security audit script: PASS within threshold
- Penetration test script: PASS (no critical failures on local)

## Known Limitations
- Attestation verification pending credentials (Epic 13.5)
- SIEM/TI feed integration deferred (Epic 13.5)
- Family account routes/UI exposure deferred (Epic 13.5)

## Recommendations
- Provide credentials and assets to finalize Epic 13.5 items
- Add external monitoring hooks (Sentry/Datadog) in production
