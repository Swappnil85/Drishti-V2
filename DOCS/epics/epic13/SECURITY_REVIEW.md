# Epic 13 Security Review

## Summary
Security hardening delivered across transport (TLS+pinning), application (consent, retention), device (integrity scoring), and operations (CI/CD, incident response).

## Controls Implemented
- Certificate pinning with monitoring and rotation
- Consent audit trail and retention automation
- Device integrity heuristics + attestation scaffolding
- Multi-format data export with receipts
- CI/CD security workflow and pentest script

## Residual Risks
- Attestation verification pending (requires credentials)
- SIEM/TI integration deferred to Epic 13.5
- Family account routes/UI exposure pending

## Recommendations
- Provide credentials and integrate verifiers
- Choose SIEM vendor (Datadog/Splunk) and feed alerts
- Add rate limiting and CSP hardening if not already enabled in infra
